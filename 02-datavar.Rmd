## Global Historical Irrigation Data Set {#HID}

Data for the target variable was collected from @siebertGlobalDataSet2015, who developed the Global Historical Irrigation Data Set or HID. This data set details the hectares of area equipped for irrigation (AEI) per grid cell at a 5 arcmin resolution ^[0.083° Longitude by 0.083° Latitude, or at the equator, a 9.3km by 9.3km grid cell] over a period of 105 years, from 1900 to 2005. By documenting global and historical irrigation patterns, @siebertGlobalDataSet2015 hoped to create a better understanding of the evolution of said patterns. It is worth noting that the dataset provided in @siebertGlobalDataSet2015 documents area equipped for irrigation, meaning area that is equipped with infrastructure to irrigate crops but not _necessarily_ irrigated. In addition, rainwater harvesting ^[The act of harvesting rainwater during rain and then later applying it to crops.] is also not included in the summation of area equipped for irrigation.

To amass this data @siebertGlobalDataSet2015 used a variety of sources to collect national and subnational statistics including FAOSTAT [@faoFAOSTAT2021], EuroStat [@europeancomissionEurostatDatabase2021], and Aquastat [@faoAQUASTAT2021] along with other less collected sources like census data and statistical yearbooks. Data was recorded for 10 year timesteps until 1980 and five year timesteps until the termination of the study period in 2005. Data for the period prior to 1950 and the year 2005 has higher levels of uncertainty in the measurements when compared to the data between, as irrigation data from international organizations (e.g. FAO) were unavailable. After collection the data was harmonized and downscaled to a 5 arcmin resolution. Special care was taken to ensure that high resolution data (at a 5 arcmin resolution) could be accurately summed to the subnational level, ensuring accuracy at different resolutions. In addition, the authors note that validation of this dataset was not possible due to the fact that all available data was used as input to create the HID.
